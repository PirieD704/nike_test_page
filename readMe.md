# Nike Test

### Instructions
To get the server up and running, navigate to the file in the command line and run 'npm start' inside the file. This will spin up a server and automatically open web page for you.

Side note: 

When looking at the mobile version through the chrome browser, it requires a refresh of the page in order to resize the svg's appropriately.  I checked the real nike mercurial website and they also require you to refresh when switching from desktop to mobile view, so I figured it was ok for test purposes.  Just wanted to note this so that you don't think I left the swooshes oversized!
